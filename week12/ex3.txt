[shamil@shamil week12]$ time ./copy temp.txt temp2.txt

--> The time slows twice as first, but as a buffer increases, the time not geometrically slows


After adding O_SYNC
buf=1000
[shamil@shamil week12]$ time ./copy temp.txt temp2.txt
real    0m3,919s

buf=2000
[shamil@shamil week12]$ time ./copy temp.txt temp2.txt
real    0m1,997s

--> The making synchronous syscall opening the file, the time increases many time (~in 300 times).
O_SYNC disables caching, that's why speed decreases.
