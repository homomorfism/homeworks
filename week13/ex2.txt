Recovery:
 + if number of processes & resources is much, it is faster that e.x. Banker Algo
 + recovery makes only ones (faster), while prevention (dynamic checking for deadlock) is made each time acquiring the resource
Prevention:
 + if number of processes & resources is much, it is faster that e.x. Banker Algo
 + mathematically proven, 100% success (e.x. we could kill some important process  during recovery and lose data)
Avoidance:
 + mathematically proven, 100% success (e.x. we could kill some important process  during recovery and lose data)
